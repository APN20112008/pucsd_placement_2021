Calculate the minimum angle between hour hand and minute hand on a standard clock.
  
Your program must accept the parameters from the command line as hour and minute value and return the angle between them in degrees rounded off to 2 decimal digits.
Sample ./a.out 09 00   Output 45.00 
Sample ./a.out 03 30   Output 75.00 
Generate the output for 09 00, 03 30, 05 00, 08 45

BONUS: Given the input as HOUR MINUTE SECOND return the minimum angle between the minute and second hand.
Generate the output for 09 00  30, 03 30 45, 05 00 50, 08 45 05
